# Project Standards & Conventions

The project will use the following conventions:
* Minitest for controller functional tests
* Scaffolding wherever possible
* RSpec for other unit tests
* Testing:
  *	Validations
  *	Associations between models
  *	Business Logic
  *	Helpers
* Rubocop for code analysis
* Don't Test:
  *	Autogenerated code in libraries
  *	Views (yet)

When making changes, a new branch should be created for the change set, then pushed to github and a pull request issued to other developers for code review. Once review is complete, merge the changeset into the master branch.

The nils_2_skills team has used Trello to manage the project. Contact team members to be added to the board.

New items added to the Trello board are given a sequential tracking number prefixed with the project intials. (Example: "N2S 024") This tracking number should be included in the commit message when changesets are committed.
