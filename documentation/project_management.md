## Future Requirements

In addition to the functionality already completed, the product owner envisioned the following changes in the future:
* While creating a plan, you are presented with the skills required of your level, of which you check  off what you already know. By adding tasks and dates for what you don't know, you build out your plan. 
* Skill level is attached to a set of skill expectations, the user is linked to assessments, and the difference in skills between expectations and assessments gets put into a plan. Those skills then get tasks attached to them, and the tasks are public so that plans created subsequently can have those tasks in their drop downs.
